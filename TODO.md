# TODO

## General

- add README

## Production ready

- make sure evrything is set up for mounting (custom mount point created,)
- add a proper logging mechanisme, at least specify commandline verbosity, maybe write to its own logfile in stead of stdout


## Long term

- make it distributed, assign one as the main server, distribute its queue task to its clients
    executable can stay the same, just start with either --client/--server
