*summary, what it does and why*

## Usage

### Starting server

### Feeding files to it


## Logging
    [-] starting an operation
    [+] finished operation
    [*] error
This makes it easy to filter the complete log with `grep grep "\[[-+*]\]" out.log` , to only show our own output and ignore ffmpegs output.
